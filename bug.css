The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can sometimes produce unexpected results when used with percentages or other relative units. For example, consider the following code:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

If the parent element's width is 200px, you might expect the element to have a width of 90px (100px - 10px). However, the actual width might differ slightly due to rounding errors or how browsers interpret the calculation.

Another issue arises when using `calc()` with multiple units.  The calculation order must be carefully considered. For example:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100px + 50%);
}
```

This adds 100px to 50% of the parent's width.  The order of operations is crucial. If the parent is 200px wide, the result is 200px (100px + 100px). However, unexpected results can happen if the parent's width changes dynamically.
